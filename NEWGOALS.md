# New Goals For Spring 2023
The expected goals for the new semester including the requirement and solutions for each goal


- React UI
> React front-end framework will be used to implement the user interface of our game. The UI should be scalable expecting more changes from the game.

- Pair the database functions with UI commands
> The game used to be a local program. With the functions from database match the functions in the endpoints, the data would be saved and manipulated in the database.

- Deployment of both the frontend and backend
> Our project will be deployed onto the free cloud platform PythonAnywhere. Frontend and backend codes will be deployed separatedly.

- Implement more functionalities of the game
> The game is still incomplete. Some functions of the game should be either added or revised locally. Those new changes will be updated with database and React frontend framework.
