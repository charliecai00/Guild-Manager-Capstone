# Progress as of January 2023
Milestones achieved so far


- Functioning API
> We have a few working endpoints that allows our user(s) to perform the basic functionalities of our game:

1. Hiring & Firing Heroes
2. Creating & Disbanding Parties
3. Listing Guild Members

- MongoDB Cloud Integration
> Our API is able to save and modify information retrieved from working endpoints into our database. As of now, the data stored doesn't persist once a user exits the game.

- Tangible Game
> Although incomplete, a new user is able to clone our project and run our game. Most of the tests we have pass, and use linting and unit testing.
